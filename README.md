Good morning all!
Here is an alarm clock to help those who go systematically in the morning.
The principle is quite simple, rather than being suddenly woken up by a ringtone or music, looking at the time, telling yourself that you still have 10 minutes and going back to dark without hearing anything, this alarm clock does not make a gift. :

it emits 1 simple beep for 2 seconds then nothing for 1 minute. It will emit 10 beeps (1 per min) then nothing!

The detail that in my opinion makes all the difference is that during these 10 minutes it is impossible to display the time. So you wake up saying to yourself "not now" and wait for the next beep, you can even go without worry. After a while, as you cannot display the time and you no longer know how many beeps there have been, for fear that the 10s have passed and you do not darken deeply, you get up without difficulty because you have no other possibility :D

I think it takes a short week for the brain to learn to respond to beeps, but overall it works well for me. Don't hesitate to give it a try and get back to me :)
